## How to use this repo

Each section is organised into **exercises**, **questions**, **challenges**, and **explore**

Not every topic will have all of these sections: sometimes there may only be an **exercises** and a **challenges** section

## Activities

- `exercises` 🖊️ - these tasks are designed for you to practice some of the essential skills in a particular topic

- `questions` ❓ - these tasks are designed to make you think critically about a given concept. They may employ a Predict observe explain format requiring you to think or contemplate a particular scenario and explain what will happen

- `challenges` 🧠 - tasks in here are designed to make you practice building/implementing functions that must fulfil certain behaviour. They are designed to encourage you to think and problem solve independently and also make sense of instructions.

- `explore` 🎨 - these tasks are purposely open-ended and designed to bring out your creative side. Coding is often about finding creative or imaginative solutions to problems and these tasks aim to get you thinking in this sort of way.
