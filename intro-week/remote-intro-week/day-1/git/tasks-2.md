Time for us to fetch the resources we’ll be using for the rest of this week as well as practice using some more :key: git commands! :grin:

Day 1 - Git Tasks - Monday afternoon

1.  Follow this link to the repo you’ll be using for the rest of the week :point_right: https://github.com/northcoders/remote-intro-week
2.  cd into your northcoders directory and then cd into your intro-week directory.
3.  Run pwd in order to confirm you’re in the right directory.
4.  :fork_and_knife: Fork the repository from step 1 so it creates a repo in your account. Here’s how to fork: https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
5.  :cyclone: Clone down the repo you just forked into your intro-week directory
6.  cd into your remote-intro-week directory and run ls to inspect the files and directories.
7.  Run ls -a to confirm that remote-intro-week has a .git directory - the directory that makes this a git repository
8.  Now run git remote -v - it should show the address of your remote repository on Github.
9.  Try opening up remote-intro-week with VSCode - ensure you’re are still in the remote-intro-week directory and then run the command `code .`. A VSCode window should appear where you can inspect all of your files and directories. :smile: If code . doesn’t work then try looking here to fix it https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview

If you manage to get through all of the above then you can check out this in the meantime:

- Have a read of this :point_right: What is Javascript ? - mdn article - some good background before your next lecture: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript
- And then extend your command line skills with this repo :point_right: https://github.com/northcoders/word-play ( you can fork and clone this repo into the northcoders/intro-week directory
