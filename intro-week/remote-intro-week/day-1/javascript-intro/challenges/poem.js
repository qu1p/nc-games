console.log(
  "Do not go gentle into that good night, \nOld age should burn and rage at close of day; \nRage, rage against the dying of the light"
);
console.log(
  "Though wise men at their end know dark is right, \nBecause their words had forked no lightning they \nDo not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright \nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
console.log(
  "Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, \nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, \nDo not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight \nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
console.log(
  "And you, my father, there on the sad height, \nCurse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray. \nDo not go gentle into that good night. \nRage, rage against the dying of the light."
);
