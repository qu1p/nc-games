// Predict -> Observe -> Explain

// It is great practice for you to start working out what code will do before it is even executed by the computer.

// In the snippet below try to work out what will be printed to the console and then exexcute the file with Node to see if you were right :)

let name;
console.log(name);

name = "Paul";
console.log(name);

// jot your thoughts down here...

// undefined
// Paul
