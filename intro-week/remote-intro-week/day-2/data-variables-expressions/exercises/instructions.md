## Task 1 - Creating variables

Complete this task in `exercises/variables.js`

In each of the following examples:

You will need to create variables representing your personal details

You need to think carefully about the data types you will use for each variable

- Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it a value represent in your name. Log this variable and log its type.

- Create a variable called `lastName` and assign it a string. Log this variable and log its type

- Create a variable called `age` and assign it a value for your age. Log this variable and log its type

## Task 2 - Creating more expressions

For this task you should use the variables you created in Task 1. You should your variables from the previous section in this task.

- Create a variable called `message` which is a string in the following form: `"Hello my name is <firstName> <lastName> and I'm <age> years old"`.
  You should look into [template literals](https://javascript.info/types#string) for this task.

- Create a variable called `initials` which is a string consisting of 2 letters - just the first letter from `firstName` and `lastName`.

- Create a variable called `fullName` which is a string in the form: `"<firstName> <lastName>"`

- Create a variable called `birthdayInfo` which is a string in the following form: `"My name is <fullName> and I was born in <yearOfBirth>"`.
  You can calculate `yearOfBirth` using your `age` variable.

- Create a variable called `petInfo` which is `"I have pets"` or `"I don't have pets"` depending on the value of your `hasPets` variable.
  You should look into [ternary operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) for this task. You should try changing the value of the `hasPets` boolean in order to observe a change in the value of the `petInfo` variable.

Run your `variables.js` file in order to print your variables to the console
