# Iteration

Work through the tasks in the following order:

**exercises** -> **challenges**

If you finish both the above, research into the following types of loops that you may not have been exposed to yet:

- `while` loops
- `do while` loops

Choose some of your challenges that you used a `for` loop and refactor to use `while` and then `do while` loops.

Have a think about when each might be useful.

**If you've finished those, have a look at day-4/problem-solving/index**
