# Array methods warm up task

_Once you have **fork**ed and then **clone**d this repository_, complete the challenges in this order:

**pop** -> **push** -> **bus-task-1** -> **bus-task-2**

Many of the challenges ask you to predict what will be logged before running the file so make sure to do this and even note down your prediction so you can compare.

If you don't understand why the output was different to your prediction, look the array method up on MDN and see if you can figure it out using the documentation.
